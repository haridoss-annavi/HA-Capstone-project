Data Science Bootcamp Capstone Project - Credit Card Fraud Prediction 


Project requirement
--------------------
FindDefault (Prediction of Credit Card fraud)

Problem Statement:
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else's credit card or credit card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. 
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Your focus in this project should be on the following: 
The following is recommendation of the steps that should be employed towards attempting to solve this problem statement: 
	Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze and understand the data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data by using Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations. 
	Data Cleaning: This might include standardization, handling the missing values and outliers in the data. 
	Dealing with Imbalanced data: This data set is highly imbalanced. The data should be balanced using the appropriate methods before moving onto model building.
	Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform the existing features for better performance of the ML Models. 
	Model Selection: Choose the most appropriate model that can be used for this project. 
	Model Training: Split the data into train & test sets and use the train set to estimate the best model parameters. 
	Model Validation: Evaluate the performance of the model on data that was not used during the training process. The goal is to estimate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data and to identify any issues with the model, such as overfitting. 
	Model Deployment: Model deployment is the process of making a trained machine learning model available for use in a production environment.

Organizing Assets for Data Science Capstone Projects
Before you begin working on your data science capstone project, it is essential to organize your assets in a structured manner to facilitate smooth submission and evaluation. Follow these guidelines for organizing your project assets during development and deployment:
During Development: In this phase, organize your project files in the following folder structure:
project-folder: Name this folder to reflect your project's name in all lowercase, using kebab casing with no spaces in the name.
1.	notebooks: This folder should contain Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts where you perform data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
2.	data: This folder should contain the dataset(s) used in the project. Include both raw and processed data, along with a README file explaining the dataset's attributes.
3.	models: This folder should contain the trained machine learning models or statistical models used in the project. Include model serialization files (e.g., Pickle files) and any model artifacts.
4.	visuals: This folder should contain data visualizations and plots generated during exploratory data analysis or model evaluation. Visualizations should be saved as image files (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
5.	README.md: This Markdown file should include a detailed description of your project, problem statement, data sources, and explanations of your code and models. Also, provide instructions on how to run your code and reproduce the results.
Deployment: When setting up your project for deployment, follow these steps:
1.	Package Dependencies: Ensure you have a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python dependencies required to run your project. This file is essential for installing the necessary libraries on the deployment server.
2.	Model Serialization: Serialize your trained models into files that can be easily loaded and used for predictions. Save them in a specific folder (e.g., "models") within your project.
3.	Data Preprocessing: Include any data preprocessing steps as separate functions or modules in your project. This ensures reproducibility during deployment.
Remember to update your README.md with instructions on how to access and interact with your deployed project. Providing clear and concise documentation ensures ease of evaluation and demonstrates your professionalism as a data scientist.
By organizing your data science capstone project assets effectively, you make it easier for evaluators to understand your work and appreciate the effort you put into building a compelling data-driven solution. Good luck with your data science capstone project!
