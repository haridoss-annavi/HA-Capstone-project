**Credit Card Fault Prediction
Overview**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict credit card faults, such as defaults or fraudulent transactions. The goal is to assist financial institutions in identifying high-risk transactions or customers, thereby reducing losses and enhancing customer security.

**Dependencies**
The project requires the following Python libraries:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scikit-learn
•	matplotlib
•	seaborn
•	jupyter

**GitHub Location**

https://github.com/haridoss-annavi/desktop-tutorial/blob/master/ha-credit-card-fraud-prediction-rf-smote.ipynb

**Model Training**

The project uses the following machine learning models to predict credit card faults:
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest Classifier
The best-performing model is chosen based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
